## Troubleshooting

- In most case if you get errors during install, don't think and just replay the main playbook (most of the errors which could came up are due to windows latency during installation, wait few minutes and replay the install)

## A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'AcceptLicense'

- If you got this kind of error you got an ansible.windows version >=  1.11.0
- This version add the parameter AcceptLicense but it is accepted only for PowerShellGet module >= 1.6.0 and this one is not embededded in the vms.
- Please keep version 1.11.0 and update the lab to get the fix for the PowerShellGet Module version.

```bash
fatal: [xxx]: FAILED! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Problems installing XXXX module: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'AcceptLicense'.",
    "nuget_changed": false,
    "output": "",
    "repository_changed": false
}
```

## old Ansible version

```bash
ERROR! no action detected in task. This often indicates a misspelled module name, or incorrect module path.
 
The error appears to have been in '/home/hrrb0032/Documents/mission/GOAD/roles/domain_controller/tasks/main.yml': line 8, column 3, but maybe elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.
 
The offending line appears to be:
 
- name: disable enhanced exit codes
^ here
```

solution : upgrade Ansible

### old ansible.windows version
```bash
ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'win_powershell'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.
```

- solution: reinstall ansible.windows module :
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows --force
```
